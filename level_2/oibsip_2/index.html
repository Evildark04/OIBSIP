                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>Elon Musk's career is as varied as it is impressive. After earning degrees in physics and economics
                    from the University of Pennsylvania, he moved to California to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams. He
                    founded a web software company called Zip2, which he later sold for almost $300 million. Musk then
                    co-founded PayPal, which revolutionized online payment systems <br> and was sold to eBay for over $1
                    billion.<br><br>
                    However, Musk's true passion lay in space exploration and renewable energy. In 2002, he founded
                    SpaceX with the goal of making space travel accessible to the public. His company has already
                    achieved numerous milestones, including launching the world's most powerful rocket,<br>the Falcon
                    Heavy, into space.<br><br>
                    Musk also founded Tesla, which has become one of the most successful electric car companies in the
                    world. He has been instrumental in driving innovation and bringing electric cars to the mainstream
                    market. In addition to his work with SpaceX and Tesla, Musk is also known for his active and
                    sometimes controversial presence on Twitter, where he has over 60 million followers.<br><br></p>

                <h2>Achievements</h2>
                <p>Elon Musk's achievements are numerous and impressive. He has been the driving force behind many
                    groundbreaking technologies that have transformed the world. He founded PayPal, an online payment
                    system, which revolutionized the way we conduct online transactions. In addition to this, he founded
                    Tesla, a company that produces electric cars and is working towards creating a sustainable energy
                    ecosystem. He is also the CEO of SpaceX, a company that designs and manufactures rockets for space
                    exploration. With SpaceX, Musk has made reusable rockets a reality, which has dramatically reduced
                    the cost of space travel.<br><br>
                    Musk has also been actively involved in the development of artificial intelligence and has warned of
                    its potential dangers to society. He has created Neuralink, a company that works on developing a
                    brain-machine interface, to enable people to connect with computers and machines directly.
                    Additionally, he has made many other notable contributions to society, including donating large sums
                    of money to charity and disaster relief efforts. His impact on technology, sustainability, and
